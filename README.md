# Karma-Pizz

A simple web-based project for an online pizza ordering system. I built it using PHP for the backend, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end, and MySQL for the database. Users can browse the menu, customize pizzas, and place orders, while the admin side lets staff manage menu items and track orders. This project demonstrates my skills in creating a complete, easy-to-use web application from scratch.
